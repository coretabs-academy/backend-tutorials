^ How to fix this code:

```
x = 5
print('hello')
```

** Just print

``` 
print('hello')
```

* It is okay to keep x, but change it

```
x = 5
x = 7
print('hello')
```

^ Does this code work:

```
x = 5
print(x + 5)
```

** Yes, but `x + 5` should be coverted into `int` type.

* No, print deals only with strings.
